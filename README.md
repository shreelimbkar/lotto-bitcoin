Lotto &amp; Bitcoin Web Portal - 888 Coding exercise

## Mock-UP

- [The Lotto calculator](https://xd.adobe.com/view/48521f4e-3e98-4409-a223-103e319597f8-1d01/)

## Notes

- You must send us your submission as an archive (e.g. ZIP) or as a Github link. No Codepen submissions or similar.
- You must only use vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript - no frameworks or libraries - no Foundation, Bootstrap, Fontawesome, jQuery etc.
- We will only test in currently supported modern browsers with supported CSS - do not use vendor prefixes.
- Pay close attention to the design, it should match the specified layout, colours etc, as best you can. (You can use a system font.)
- Links and buttons should have a hover state.
- The design should be horizontally centred on the screen.
- The maximum width (as per the mock-up) is 1280px. Below this maximum width the layout should be fluid.
- The design should be responsive: At a breakpoint of <600px, the header, sidebar, form and table should all stack in a single column. You can set a minimum width if you like.
